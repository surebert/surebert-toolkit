//all the p tags with class red inside myDiv
myDiv.s$('.red');

because of this I removed sb.element.prototype.getElementsByClassName

//is now 
var comments = entry.s$('.comments')[0];

switched sb.effects onEnd so that it stops the effect aand then runs onEnd, this way if the onEnd throws an error, the effect doesn't continue

sb.consol.log now escapes HTML again as it should have.

sb.ie6 now defaults to type text when creating sb.element input that does not have the type specified
